🚀 Introducing FRIDAY – My Python AI Voice Assistant! 🤖

I’ve built a voice-activated AI assistant named FRIDAY using Python! This project combines speech recognition, web automation, text-to-speech, and music playback, making it a dynamic tool to streamline day-to-day tasks and interact with the web in real-time.

Key Features:
Speech Recognition & Interaction: FRIDAY listens for commands using Google’s speech recognition API and responds with relevant actions.
Web Automation: Automatically opens popular websites like Google, YouTube, LinkedIn, Gmail, and even tools like speed test sites with a simple voice command.
Music Playback: FRIDAY can play a random song or specific playlists from a predefined music library via YouTube or other streaming services.
Real-Time News Updates: FRIDAY fetches the latest news headlines from the NewsAPI and reads them out loud.
Joke Generator: Lighten the mood with jokes delivered straight from the PyJokes library.
QR Code Scanner: Integrated QR code scanner to handle scanning tasks.
Custom Password Protection: The assistant is protected with a password, ensuring secure access to commands.
Error Handling: Robust exception handling ensures smooth user experience, even in case of network or command recognition failures.
Text-to-Speech Functionality: Converts responses to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), providing an interactive voice response.
